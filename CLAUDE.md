## UI / Layout Rules

- **Alignment is critical.** Content should be centered within its container — never left-hanging when there's available space. Always use `mx-auto` (or equivalent centering) on constrained-width containers (`max-w-*`).
- **Spacing and padding must be even and consistent.** Matching elements (cards, panels, sections) should have identical padding, gaps, and margins. Avoid asymmetric spacing unless there's a clear design reason.
- When in doubt, center it.
